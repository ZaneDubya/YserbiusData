2,"   Using the mouse, click on a card and hold down the button. Drag the card to the middle of the screen.\n   With a keyboard, move the pointer to a card with the arrow (or keypad) keys, press [Enter], press the up arrow, then press [Enter] again."
3,"   Hearts is a card game to be played by three or four players. At the beginning of a round of play the deck is shuffled and all of the cards are dealt to the players. In a three player game, the two of diamonds is tossed out to make an even deck. Each player passes their three least desirable cards to the opponent on their left."
4,"   The player with the deuce of clubs begins play by leading with that card. Each player must \"follow suit,\" meaning that if a club is put down, each other player must play a club unless they don't have one, in which case they may put down any card they like."
5,"   After each player has played a card, the one who played the highest card following the lead suit wins the trick. The winner leads the next hand.\n   Each card you win with a heart on it counts one point against you. This version of the game is \"Black Lady\" Hearts. If you \"win\" the Queen of Spades, 13 points are counted against you."
6,"   There is an automatic scoring convention in Hearts called \"Shooting The Moon.\" If you get all the hearts (13 of them) and the Queen of Spades, everyone else will have 26 points scored against them.\n   After each round, the scores are tabulated. Play will continue until a player's score reaches 100 points. The player with the LOWEST score wins."
