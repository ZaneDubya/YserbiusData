38,"   Kings move one square in any direction unless castling."
39,"   To castle, move the king two spaces toward the rook. The rook is placed on the square next to the king towards the center."
40,"Castling is legal if:
   1) Neither the king nor the rook have moved yet,
   2) no pieces stand between the king and the rook,
   3) no enemy piece attacks squares which the king must travel over, and
   4) the king is not in check."

45,"   On their 1st move, pawns move straight forward one or two squares. From then on they: a) move straight forward one square onto an empty square, OR b) capture by moving one square diagonally forward and removing an opponent's piece there. Pawns never move backwards."
46,"Promotion:
   If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it is replaced by a queen, rook, bishop or knight of the same color."
47,"En Passant:
   If an opponent's pawn moves forward two squares ending up next to one of your pawns, it can be captured as if it had only moved one square. You have this option only on the first move after the opponent's pawn moves."
