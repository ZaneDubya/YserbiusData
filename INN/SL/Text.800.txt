0,"The Flag"
1,"   If your opponent finds your Flag, you lose. The Flag cannot be moved."
2,"The Marshal - rank 1"
3,"   The Marshal is the strongest piece on the board but can be captured by a spy. You have only one Marshal."
4,"The General - rank 2"
5,"   The General is the second strongest piece. You have only one General, and he should be used carefully."
6,"Colonels - rank 3"
7,"   Though not as powerful as the General or the Marshal, Colonels are strong pieces which can be used to defend against most attacks."
8,"Majors - rank 4"
9,"   The Majors are just better than average in strength."
10,"Captains - rank 5"
11,"   Captains make excellent backup. They are average in strength and can be used for more dangerous missions."
12,"Lieutenants - rank 6"
13,"   Lieutenants are your weakest officer. They make competent scouts once you've lost all your scouts!"
14,"Sergeants - rank 7"
15,"   Since Sergeants outrank Miners they make excellent guards for bombs if the need arises."
16,"Miners - rank 8"
17,"   Miners are the only piece that can \"defeat\" a bomb by defusing it. Save them. You'll need them!"
18,"Scouts - rank 9"
19,"   The Scout is the only piece that can move more than a single space per turn. Though weak, Scouts can be a very important tool and should not be wasted."
20,"The Spy"
21,"   The Spy loses every battle except when he attacks the Marshal. If the Marshal attacks the Spy first, the Spy is captured; so only a clever spy will get the Marshal."
22,"Bombs"
23,"   Bombs explode, destroying all pieces except for the Miner who defuses them. They are a very valuable means of protecting your Flag."
